Pipeline Persistence
====================

Pipeline Persistence is a next generation API designed to replace Hibernate/JPA and other heavy-weight tools that require complex setup and place unreasonable demands on the developer using the API.

Pipeline started by looking at the problem of persistence in Java completely from scratch and stealing only the very best ideas from existing persistence frameworks while adding our own simple idioms.

The 3 guiding principles:

1. No black magic
2. Easy to test
3. Reads like a book

The API is written in a manner that makes it easy to retrofit crusty JDBC and Hibernate applications with quality, testable code.
