Pipeline Persistence
====================
Java. SQL. Performance.

Pipeline Persistence is a lightweight API designed to combat the complexity introduced by heavy ORM tools like Hibernate and JPA which unreasonable demands on the developer during setup, development and maintenance.

Pipeline was crafted by looking at the problem of persistence in Java completely from scratch and scavaging only the very best ideas from existing projects while adding our own simple idioms, the core of which are these:

1. Write programs that do one thing and do it well, also known as the Unix Philosophy.  This means a set of small, easy to use tools that developers can combine to get the features they want without drowning in a framework.
2. Rather than telling Java what SQL to build, let SQL do the talking and tell Java what to build.

By Example


The 3 guiding principles:

1. Just Java and SQL, no magic
2. Simple to test
3. Simple to maintain
